Version 0.7.7

* Fixed bug with reading broken wav files with bad sizes
* Fixed bug causing seg fault on non-PCM wav files
* Fixed bug with reading wav files that have stuff after the data chunk
* Fixed Windows "no such file" bug
* Fixed small memory leak
* Fixed cosmetic bug with negative gains
* Fixed bad basename regexp in normalize-mp3 script
* Fixed --oggdecode option in normalize-mp3 script
* Turned audiofile support on by default
* Upgraded to latest GNU autotools


Version 0.7.6.1

* Documentation, license, and email address updates.  No code changes.


Version 0.7.6

* Fixed off-by-one bug causing any ID3 tag greater than 256 bytes in
  size to come out corrupt.
* Several updates and fixes for the normalize-mp3 script, including
  FLAC support.


Version 0.7.5

* Fixed command-line parsing bugs in normalize-mp3 script
* Fixed problem with reading mp3s with bad CRCs.
* Fixed cosmetic bug in displaying negative decibel gains
* Recognize .mp2 files
* Updated translations


Version 0.7.4

* Fixed several bugs in ID3 code that were causing bus errors on
  ID3v2.2 tags on non-intel architectures.
* Fixed bug in ID3 version converting routines causing seg faults
* Fixed ID3 version converting bug causing incorrect conversion for
  some frames


Version 0.7.3

* Fixed bug causing segmentation faults on certain unusual mp3 files
* Fixed bug causing false FAIL messages on "make check"
* Fixed bug in frontend message code
* Upgraded to latest GNU autotools


Version 0.7.2

* Fixed a bug that was causing "normalize -bn" to display the wrong
  volume adjustment on the last line.  The bug was cosmetic, i.e. the
  correct adjustment was applied if -n was not specified.
* Fixes to normalize-mp3 script for compatibility with older perl
  versions.


Version 0.7.1

* Overhauled normalize-mp3 script.  Now written in perl, supports
  batch and mix mode, and doesn't choke on some filenames anymore.
  Note that the -b option has changed: you must use --bitrate now.
* Running "normalize -g 0dB X.mp3" now removes the volume adjust info
* Added experimental --frontend option
* Fixed bug in gain display with -mn specified
* Fixed bug in WAV writing code causing problems with oggenc
* Fixed non-POSIX badness causing BSD compile problems
* Fixes for OS/2
* Updated to gettext 0.11
* Various autoconf updates


Version 0.7

* Added optional mad library support, for reading MP3 files
* Added optional audiofile library support, for reading various audio
  formats
* Added support for ID3 tags, to set relative volume adjustment
  information in MP3 files
* Added xmms plugin to use ID3 tag information
* Added -w option to force output sample width
* Added --no-progress and --query options for frontends


Version 0.6.1

* Overhauled normalize-mp3 script.  It now works on ogg vorbis files,
  and preserves ID3 or ogg tags over the re-encode process.
* Added normalize-ogg as link to normalize-mp3
* Fixed build problems on freebsd and cygwin


Version 0.6

* Improved limiter (no more clipping!).  Adjustment with limiting is
  much more accurate.  Limiting is on by default now, so the -c option
  is deprecated, and the --clipping option has been added to turn
  limiting off.
* Added -l option to control limiter.
* Added -T option to set "don't bother adjusting" threshold
* Fixed bug giving spurious error message on amiga
* Fixed bug in printing output when reading from stdin
* Added -n and -T options to normalize-mp3 script
* Fixed bug in normalize-mp3 script with certain filenames
* Made all opens binary for compatibility with cygwin
* Minor speedup fix
* Code cleanups
* Config fixes for compatibility with new versions of automake & autoconf


Version 0.5.2

* Fixed bug with -c option.  It was not turning compression on.
* Fixed bug in dealing with corrupt files.


Version 0.5.1

* All gain values in dB, all amplitudes in dBFS (option `--fractions'
  added to get gains and amplitudes as fractions of 1.0 instead)
* Added -c option to turn on compression
* No longer do compression if we don't need to
* The -n option now prints out peak values and gains
* Keep track of clippings, even when using lookup table
* Fixed bugs with 24 and 32 bit WAV files
* Other minor bugfixes


Version 0.5

* Added dynamic range compression instead of clipping
* Added --peak option to normalize by peak instead of RMS
* The -a option now also accepts values in decibels less than full
  scale (dBFS)
* Speed improvement
* normalize-mp3 script now skips files that are already normalized
* Other minor bugfixes and cleanups


Version 0.4.1

* Bug fixed: decibel gains supplied to -g option were doubled in v0.4.
* Bug fixed: report of needed adjustment in dB was halved in v0.4 (it
  was consistent with -g option bug).  Adjustments calculated by v0.4
  should not be used with any other version.


Version 0.4

* Added ability to compute volume of data from standard input
* Adjustments now measured in decibels
* Already-normalized files are now skipped
* Files are adjusted in place, no longer use temporary files
* Minor bugfixes
* Various code cleanups


Version 0.3.4

* Bug fixed in handling files less than one second long
* Added normalize-mp3 script
* Various code cleanups


Version 0.3.3

* Bug fixed in statistical volume analysis for mix mode.


Version 0.3.2

* Fix for bug with long filenames.


Version 0.3.1

* Initial public release.
